In software development, interpreting user needs begins with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. User stories are essential tools that help translate those needs into actionable development tasks. Each user story defines who the user is, what they want to achieve, and why it is important. By breaking down the user’s goals into specific and testable criteria, I can ensure that the final product aligns with their expectations and provides real value. Creating user stories also helps prioritize development work, guiding the team to focus on the most important features first.

When developing programs, I approach each project by following structured and iterative processes. I have learned the value of Agile methodologies, especially Scrum, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily standups, and regular retrospectives. These processes help maintain a steady workflow, allow for quick adaptation to change, and encourage consistent communication among team members. Working in short, focused iterations also makes it easier to gather feedback early and adjust before problems become larger issues.

Being a good team member in software development means contributing to the group’s success through communication, accountability, and mutual respect. It requires being open to feedback, supporting teammates when challenges arise, and maintaining a positive and solution-oriented attitude. Collaboration is key in Agile environments, and each team member must understand how their role contributes to the project’s overall success. A good team member listens actively, completes tasks on time, and helps create an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing ideas and taking ownership of their work.
